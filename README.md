# Hands-on session

## Requirements:
You will be using myqlm, a free library for fermionic simulation developed by Atos. I advise that you use Google colab to open the notebooks. If you want to make the code run on your own laptop, note that you have to install myqlm:

`pip install myqlm`
`pip install myqlm-simulators`

Documentation about the software can be found [here](https://myqlm.github.io).
